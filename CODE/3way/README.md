## 3 way code

The code here allows to run the 3-way log-linear regression models.

- glm-inputs: code to compute the inputs for the log-linear regression models from the binary matrices.

- glm-outputs: code to run the log-linear regression models.

- Permut: code obtain the number of false significant pairs and compute the average FDR.

- fdr-correction: false discovery rate correction of the log-linear regression *P*-value based on the permuted counts.

- Hallmarks: code for the cancer hallmarks analysis.
