### This code allows to run all the analysis in our work.

- *2way* folder has the code for the 2-way log-linear regression models: across cancer types, subtypes, treatment and confounding factors models.

- *3way* folder has the code for the 3-way log-linear regression models.

- *Preprocessing* folder has the code to process the raw data (see the README file in DATA directory for details).

- *Survival* folder has the code for the survival analysis, including sample clasification according their mutation status and Cox regression models.

The additional script is necessary as it includes functions used by the other scripts.
